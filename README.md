## Game Theory
- to touch Lord Pepe II - The Clown's Nose, you need to pay a fee of 69 $NOSE.
- fee increases by 69 $NOSE every hour.
- whenever someone touches the Nose, timer for 1 hour resets, if no one touches the Nose for a whole hour, Game Ends.
- anyone can touch Lord Pepe II - The Clown's Nose, in hopes of receiving a blessing, but only the Last 20 wanderers that touched the Nose, are worthy of his blessings!
- worry not tho for our Lord has a big heart, you can choose to share you're address as referral to other brave wanderers.
- each referral account gets credited with 10% of transaction fee for touching the Nose (players can't refer themselves, by default if no referral is used - sewyash.eth referral is used (dev's address).
- *"dev don't take any cut from the game, only way dev makes money from the game is if users use a default referral address."*
- *once game ends wait for dev to Release the token's to the winners by calling 'ownerEndGame' function, this is required as evm blokchains need someone to pay the gas to make any changes.*
- *pot fund is used to line up game's pot beginning of every round, first round will make the most use of it and then every round the amount put up as starting pot decreases*
- whenever someone touches Lord Pepe II - The Clown's Nose, the fees is divided into few parts: 

| 69 % | To the Total Pot/Blessings |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| 10 % | Referral Address           |
| 21 % | Burns $NOSE tokens         |
| 20   | Number of Blessed Winners  |
| 69 $NOSE | Initial Price of touching the NOSE |

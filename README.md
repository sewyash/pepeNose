## Game Theory
- to touch Lord Pepe II - The Clown's Nose, you need to pay a fee of 69 $NOSE.
- fee increases by 69 $NOSE every hour.
- whenever someone touches the Nose, timer for 1 hour resets, if no one touches the Nose for a whole hour, Game Ends.
- anyone can touch Lord Pepe II - The Clown's Nose, in hopes of receiving a blessing, but only the Last 20 wanderers that touched the Nose, are worthy of his blessings!
- worry not tho for our Lord has a big heart, you can choose to share you're address as referral to other brave wanderers.
- each referral account gets credited with 10% of transaction fee for touching the Nose (players can't refer themselves, by default if no referral is used - sewyash.eth referral is used (dev's address).
- *"dev don't take any cut from the game, only way dev makes money from the game is if users use a default referral address."*
- whenever someone touches Lord Pepe II - The Clown's Nose, the fees is divided into few parts: 

| 69 % | To the Total Pot/Blessings |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| 10 % | Referral Address           |
| 21 % | Burns $NOSE tokens         |
| 20   | Number of Blessed Winners  |
| 69 $NOSE | Initial Price of touching the NOSE |
